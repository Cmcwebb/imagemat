&nbsp;Making the T more obvious
</span>
<p>
Design rational:  I found that for the really tiny images shown any attempt to
provide detail was self defeating.  I went with the broad color scheme used
in our original logo, matching the colors as closely as I could absent the
actual logo colour info.  The three bars seem like columns, suggesting both
ancient history, and also a gateway.  The M of image mate can almost be
imagined in the three columns, and visually so also can the T when the
grey area above the columns is considered the bar of the T. 
<p>
I'm not sure
that trying to make the T more obvious helps given the current background
colour. The red at the bottom was supposed to represent the word image,
but I now see it more suggestive of a red carpet infront of the inviting
gateway.  All very fanciful, but that's the type of blur a museum would
give this artwork :-)
